# The script is self-contained: every file it writes is embedded here. It has no

# empty directory, in an existing repository, or anywhere else — it scaffolds
# relative to the target directory, never to a hardcoded path.
#
#   ./scripts/bootstrap.sh                 # scaffold into the current directory
#   ./scripts/bootstrap.sh --dir ~/work/x  # scaffold into another directory
#   ./scripts/bootstrap.sh --dry-run       # show what would happen, write nothing
#   ./scripts/bootstrap.sh --force         # overwrite files that already differ
#
# It is idempotent: an unchanged file is left alone, an existing file that
# differs is kept and reported unless --force is given. Nothing is ever deleted.

bootstrap.sh — scaffold the NSX/VCF Terraform repository layout.

Usage: bootstrap.sh                 # interactive menu
       bootstrap.sh [options]       # scripted; any flag suppresses the menu

Run it with no arguments and it asks: basic deployment (best practices assumed,
three questions), advanced (every option), or update an existing tree. The menu
prints the equivalent command line before it does anything, so one pass through
it teaches the flags below. Any flag on the command line means a script is
driving, so the menu stays out of the way.

Options:
      --vcs KIND      Where these files live and how changes are reviewed.
                      GitLab is the default: it is the only host this script can
                      set up end to end rather than leaving files to wire up.

                        gitlab          an existing GitLab. Full pipeline.
                                        Pass --git-remote URL.       [default]
                        gitlab-docker   stand up GitLab CE and a runner in
                                        Docker, create the repository, push,
                                        register the runner, and print the
                                        initial root password.
                        github          GitHub. Workflows are written; you set
                                        the secrets and protect the apply
                                        environments.
                        git             another git host. Both sets of CI files
                                        are written and their location printed.
                        none            local files only. No versioning, no
                                        pipeline — plan and apply by hand.

                      Changeable later with scripts/enable-gitops.sh, which
                      writes whatever pipeline is missing.
      --ci PLATFORM   Which pipeline definitions to write: gitlab, github, both
                      or none. Follows --vcs unless given explicitly.
      --git-remote URL
                      Remote to attach as 'origin'.
      --git-branch NAME
                      Default branch name (default: main).
  -i, --interactive   Force the menu even when other flags are given.
      --no-interactive
                      Never show the menu; use defaults and the flags given.
  -d, --dir PATH      Target directory (default: current working directory).
                      Created if it does not exist.
  -f, --force         Overwrite existing REGENERATED files whose content
                      differs — modules, stacks, scripts, CI, schemas, docs.
                      Never touches estate data. This is the flag to use when
                      picking up a newer version of the scaffold.
      --force-data    Also overwrite estate data: data/groups, data/policies,
                      data/services, data/network, data/platform,
                      data/schema/tag-scopes.yaml, inventory/ and envs/.
                      Refuses outright for any file recorded in
                      data/.import-manifest.json — imported estate is never
                      overwritten by this script. Implies --force.
      --confirm TEXT  Supply the overwrite confirmation phrase non-interactively,
                      for a pipeline. Must match exactly; also read from
                      BOOTSTRAP_CONFIRM. Without a terminal and without this,
                      an overwrite aborts rather than proceeding.

WITHOUT A FLAG, NOTHING EXISTING IS EVER OVERWRITTEN. A file that differs from
what this script would write is kept, reported, and the run exits 2.

WITH --force OR --force-data, the first file that would actually be overwritten
stops the run and asks you to type a confirmation phrase in full. Answer once
and it covers the rest of the run; answer wrong and nothing is overwritten. A
flag in shell history should not be able to revert a tree somebody has spent
months editing.
      --no-examples   Skip the example data files (inventory entry, groups,
                      policies, services, network and platform data). The
                      structure, modules, stacks, schemas and tooling are
                      still written.
      --backend TYPE  State backend written into stacks/*/backend.tf. Case
                      insensitive; the friendly names in brackets also work.

                        http     GitLab-managed Terraform state  [gitlab]
                                 Locking, encryption at rest and versioning
                                 come from GitLab. Credentials come from
                                 TF_HTTP_USERNAME and TF_HTTP_PASSWORD, never
                                 from a committed file.
                        s3       S3 or an S3-compatible store  [minio, ceph]
                                 Needs DynamoDB or native locking configured.
                        azurerm  Azure blob storage  [azure]
                        local    Filesystem on this server  [file, filesystem]
                                 NO LOCKING. The default, and the placeholder:
                                 it exists so the stacks initialise for offline
                                 validation.

                      Whatever you choose, state carries the full security
                      posture of the estate. It never goes in a git repository:
                      plaintext, permanent history, and no locking.
      --git-init      Run 'git init' in the target directory if it is not
                      already inside a git working tree.
  -n, --dry-run       Report what would be written; change nothing.
  -q, --quiet         Only print the summary and any warnings.
  -h, --help          Show this help.
      --version       Print the bootstrap script version.

Estate data is what describes YOUR network — the rules, groups, segments and
managers. It is written once, on a first run into an empty directory, and from
then on it belongs to you. Regenerated files are this script's own output and
are safe to refresh.

Exit status is 0 on success, 1 on error, 2 if files were skipped because they
already exist with different content (re-run with --force to overwrite).

# Starting from the estate you already have

You are not building a new network. NSX is already running, the rules already
carry traffic, and nothing here may create a second copy of any of it.

The whole approach is **adopt, never recreate**: read what exists, write it out
as data, and hand Terraform the existing objects by id so that the first apply
changes nothing at all. A tranche is finished when `terraform plan` says *no
changes* — not when it applies cleanly.

## Before you start

1. `make preflight`
2. Put the real managers in `inventory/managers.yaml` and add one
   `envs/<site>.backend.hcl` each.
3. Pick a **pilot**: one site, one application. Not the busiest one, and not
   production-critical on the first pass.

## Step 1 — capture the estate

Credentials come from the environment, never from a file:

```bash
scripts/with-credentials.sh lon1 -- scripts/import-estate.py \
    --site lon1 --dump-only reports/lon1-raw.json
```

`reports/` is gitignored. The dump is a read-only snapshot of your security
posture — treat it like a plan file.

Capturing separately from converting means you can iterate on the conversion
without hammering the manager, and you can review exactly what was read.

## Step 2 — convert it to data

```bash
scripts/import-estate.py --site lon1 --from-dump reports/lon1-raw.json
```

Which writes:

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `data/groups/imported-<site>.yaml` | groups, with NSX expressions converted to criteria |
| `data/policies/<policy-id>.yaml` | one file per policy — this is what makes rule reuse work |
| `data/services/imported-<site>.yaml` | custom services; predefined ones are referenced, not copied |
| `stacks/<stack>/import.tf` | the import blocks |
| `data/.import-manifest.json` | what was imported and from where |

**Nothing you already have is overwritten.** If a target exists the tool writes
`<name>.new` beside it and tells you, so you diff and merge by hand.

## Step 3 — read what it produced

This is the step people skip. The converter is faithful, not clever:

- Every group with static IP membership gets a placeholder `why_static`. Replace
  it with the real reason, or make the group dynamic.
- Tag scopes must exist in `data/schema/tag-scopes.yaml`. Real estates contain
  scopes nobody documented; add them deliberately rather than in bulk.
- Rules with an empty `scope` are rules NSX is pushing to every host in the
  span. The importer records what is there; `make validate` will fail them.
  That failure is a finding about your estate, not a bug.
- Object keys are the real nsx_ids and are adopted **verbatim** — mixed case and
  underscores included. They must match or the import misses. The naming
  convention applies to objects you create from here on, and the validator
  knows the difference.

```bash
make validate
```

## Step 4 — import one tranche

```bash
scripts/with-credentials.sh lon1 -- scripts/tf.sh plan local-security lon1
scripts/tf.sh show local-security lon1
```

Read the plan against this bar:

- Every object appears as an **import**, not a create.
- **Zero** creates, updates or destroys. A create means Terraform did not
  recognise something that exists — stop; do not apply, or you get a duplicate.
- An update usually means the data does not match reality yet. Fix the data,
  not the manager.

When the plan is a pure import:

```bash
APPROVE=yes scripts/with-credentials.sh lon1 -- \
    scripts/tf.sh apply local-security lon1
```

Then confirm the follow-up plan is empty, and delete `import.tf` — import blocks
are one-shot.

### If every import fails with a not-found error

The id format is wrong for your provider version, and **nothing has been written
to state** — it is a safe failure. Re-run the converter with a different form:

```bash
scripts/import-estate.py --site lon1 --from-dump reports/lon1-raw.json --id-format domain-id
```

`path` (the default), `domain-id` and `id` are the three the nsxt provider has
used. Confirm on the pilot; the rest of the estate then uses the same one.

## Step 5 — repeat, one tranche at a time

One policy or one site per pass, each its own PR. A PR spanning multiple sites
cannot be rolled back cleanly.

## After the import: your data is yours

Two guarantees, both enforced rather than documented:

- `bootstrap.sh` will not overwrite estate data with `--force`, and refuses
  outright — even with `--force-data` — for anything in the import manifest.
- Drift detection is read-only. `scripts/drift.sh` runs a refresh-only plan,
  writes its report to `reports/`, and **never** writes back into `data/`. Drift
  is a ticket for a human, not an automatic rewrite of your imported estate.

## Adding a rule after importing

The point of one-file-per-policy: the rule goes into the policy that already
exists.

```bash
scripts/add-rule.py --policy legacy-app --rule allow-monitoring \
    --source prod-monitoring --destination legacy-web \
    --service https --scope legacy-web
```

It finds `legacy-app` by id or display name, appends to that file, and allocates
the next free sequence number. If the policy does not exist it stops and tells
you — creating one needs `--create-policy`, because a new policy is a new
category placement, a new ordering, and a new blast radius.

# NSX Terraform

Terraform for NSX across a multi-VCF estate: one Global Manager owning the
federated distributed firewall, 10+ Local Managers owning their own networking,
and **firewall rules kept as reviewed data rather than as HCL edits or clicks in
the NSX UI**.

Generated by `scripts/bootstrap.sh`. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the design
and the rules, and `docs/STRUCTURE.md` for what each directory holds.

## The idea in one screen

A day-to-day change is a YAML edit, reviewed like code and applied by the
pipeline:

```yaml
# data/policies/payments.yaml
rules:
  allow-web-to-app:
    sequence_number: 300
    source_groups: [prod-payments-web]
    destination_groups: [prod-payments-app]
    services: [https]
    scope: [prod-payments-app]     # mandatory: bounds where the rule is pushed
    action: ALLOW
```

Nobody writes that by hand either:

```bash
make add-rule POLICY=prod-payments RULE=allow-web-to-app \
  ARGS='--source prod-payments-web --destination prod-payments-app --service https --scope prod-payments-app'
make validate
make plan STACK=global-security SITE=gm1
```

Groups are selected by tag, so membership follows the workload instead of being
maintained by hand. Tags come either from your provisioning system or from
`data/vm-tags/` — `docs/TAGGING.md` covers the choice.

## Layout

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `inventory/managers.yaml` | Every GM and LM. Adding a manager is a data change. |
| `data/` | Groups, policies, services, per-site network/platform, VM tags. |
| `data/schema/` | JSON Schema and the tag vocabulary. Enforced in CI. |
| `modules/` | One module per NSX object kind. `for_each`, never `count`. |
| `stacks/` | One root module per state boundary, run once per manager. |
| `scripts/` | Validation, CI matrix, credentials, import, rule and tag edits. |

Five stacks, split by change cadence and blast radius so a daily rule edit never
refreshes a transport zone:

| Stack | Runs on | Cadence | Blast radius |
|---|---|---|---|
| `global-security` | GM | daily | all sites |
| `local-security` | each LM | weekly | one site |
| `local-tags` | each LM | daily | the VMs listed |
| `local-network` | each LM | weekly | one site |
| `platform` | each LM | rarely | one site, total |

## Getting started

```bash
make preflight     # are the tools here
make validate      # schema + convention checks. Offline, no credentials.
make ready         # what still stands between this and production
make matrix        # what CI would run, derived from the inventory
```

`make ready` is the honest one. A freshly generated tree is **not** production
ready and it will tell you exactly why — placeholder backend, example data, no
lock files, no remote — and exit non-zero until those are dealt with. It also
lists what it cannot see: branch protection, CI variables, and whether a plan
has ever run against a real manager.

Then, in order:

1. Replace `inventory/managers.yaml` — everything derives from it.
2. Add one `envs/<site>.backend.hcl` per manager.
3. **Decide the state backend.** The default is a placeholder `backend "local"`,
   which has no locking and is not acceptable for a real manager. Pick one with
   `scripts/bootstrap.sh --force --backend gitlab|s3|azure|local`, then fill in
   `envs/<site>.backend.hcl`.
4. `terraform init` in one stack and commit the `.terraform.lock.hcl`.
5. Adopt what already exists: `make import SITE=<site>`, per `docs/IMPORT.md`.

Everything under `data/` and `inventory/` ships as realistic example content
describing no real site. Replace it, or regenerate with `--no-examples`.

## Getting changes reviewed

A rule change should be a merge request, not an edit somebody made on a
Tuesday. The pipeline files are already here:

```
edit data/policies/*.yaml -> MR -> validate -> plan posted to the MR
   -> approver reads the PLAN -> merge -> MANUAL apply of the SAVED plan
```

The apply never re-plans; it applies the artifact the approver looked at.

If this tree has no remote yet:

```bash
scripts/enable-gitops.sh --remote git@gitlab.example.com:net/nsx.git
scripts/enable-gitops.sh --local-gitlab   # or stand GitLab up in Docker
```

`docs/GITOPS.md` covers the CI variables, the branch protection this depends on,
and what the approver is checking.

## Re-running the generator

`scripts/bootstrap.sh` is safe to re-run, and it is how you take updates. Run it
bare and it offers a menu — pick **Update an existing tree**, which keeps the
state backend this tree already uses, never re-seeds example data, and offers a
dry run first:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

**With no flag it never overwrites anything that already exists.** A file whose
content differs is kept and reported, the run exits `2`, and files that are
missing are still added.

**Overwriting takes a flag *and* a typed phrase.** `--force` alone does not do
it: the first file that would be overwritten stops the run and asks for
`wipe everything & start fresh`, typed in full. Anything else aborts having
changed nothing.

| Command | Overwrites |
|---|---|
| *(no flag)* | nothing — differing files kept, exit 2 |
| `--force` | generator output only: modules, stacks, scripts, schemas, CI, docs |
| `--force-data` | the above **and** `data/`, `inventory/`, `envs/` |

It **never deletes**, and anything recorded in `data/.import-manifest.json` is
**never** overwritten — flag and phrase or not. Commit before a `--force` run:
git is the real undo.

## Before you touch a live manager

- No `terraform plan` in this repository has ever run against an NSX manager.
  Provider schema validity is not API validity.
- `scripts/tf.sh` refuses to apply without a saved plan and `APPROVE=yes`.
- State and saved plans carry the estate's full security posture. They are
  sensitive, and they never land in git.

Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 2 — ten things that will break this
repository — before the first change.

# A rule change is a merge request

The point of this repository is that nobody edits the firewall. They edit a
file, and a pipeline turns that into a plan somebody approves.

```
  engineer edits data/policies/payments.yaml
        |
        v
  push a branch, open a merge request
        |
        v
  VALIDATE   schemas and conventions. Offline, no credentials.
  PLAN       one job per manager, READ-ONLY credentials.
             The rendered plan is posted onto the merge request.
        |
        v
  APPROVER   reads the plan, not the YAML. Count delta, no unexpected
             destroys, scope set, default rule untouched. Approves.
        |
        v
  MERGE      to the default branch.
        |
        v
  APPLY      a MANUAL job on a protected environment, applying the SAVED
             plan artifact — never a fresh one.
```

The last step is the one that matters: **apply never re-plans.** It applies the
artifact the approver looked at. If the estate drifted in between, the apply
fails on a stale plan rather than quietly doing something nobody reviewed.

## What makes it safe

| Control | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| Nobody can push to the default branch | branch protection, on the git host |
| A change needs another person | merge request approval rules |
| Plans cannot write | `VAULT_PLAN_TOKEN` is read-only |
| Only protected branches can write | `VAULT_APPLY_TOKEN` marked **protected** |
| Apply needs a human | manual job + protected environment |
| Apply cannot re-plan | `scripts/tf.sh apply` refuses without a saved plan and `APPROVE=yes` |
| Bad data never reaches a plan | `scripts/validate-data.py` in the validate stage |

Four of those live on the git host rather than in this repository. Setting them
is part of the job — a pipeline without branch protection is a pipeline that
anybody can bypass by pushing to the default branch.

## Which pipeline you get

Chosen at first run and recorded in `.nsx-bootstrap.conf`, so a later re-run
does not quietly change it.

| Choice | Written | Set up for you |
|---|---|---|
| **GitLab** *(default)* | `.gitlab-ci.yml`, the child-pipeline generator, an MR template | repository, runner, variables and gate, if you let it |
| GitHub | `.github/workflows/{validate,plan,apply}.yml`, a PR template | nothing — you set the secrets and protect the environments |
| Another git host | both of the above | nothing; point your host at whichever it reads |
| Local only | nothing | nothing — `make plan` / `make apply` by hand |

GitLab is the default because it is the only one this script can take all the
way: `scripts/gitlab-up.sh` will stand the server up, create the project, push,
register a runner and print the root password. For GitHub the workflows are
correct and complete, but the secrets and the environment protection are yours
to set, and nothing here can do it for you.

## Setting it up

Three ways in, all producing the same pipeline:

```bash
# 1. an existing repository
scripts/enable-gitops.sh --remote git@gitlab.example.com:net/nsx-terraform.git

# 2. no GitLab yet — stand one up in Docker
scripts/enable-gitops.sh --local-gitlab      # or scripts/gitlab-up.sh

# 3. at first run
scripts/bootstrap.sh                          # the menu asks
```

Nothing in the repository changes between them: `.gitlab-ci.yml`,
`.github/workflows/` and the helper scripts are always generated. Choosing later
costs nothing, which is why "local only, decide later" is a supported answer
rather than a trap.

### CI variables

| Variable | Value | Flags |
|---|---|---|
| `VAULT_ADDR` | Vault endpoint | masked |
| `VAULT_PLAN_TOKEN` | **read-only** token | masked |
| `VAULT_APPLY_TOKEN` | write token | masked, **protected** |
| `CI_API_TOKEN` | project token, `api` scope, so plans can be posted to the MR | masked |
| `NSX_APPLY_MODE` | `manual` (default) or `auto` | optional |

If `CI_API_TOKEN` is absent the pipeline still runs; it just does not comment,
and the approver reads the plan in the job log instead.

On GitHub the equivalents are repository secrets `VAULT_ADDR`,
`VAULT_PLAN_TOKEN` and `VAULT_APPLY_TOKEN`; the plan comment uses the built-in
`GITHUB_TOKEN` and needs nothing extra. The apply gate is
**Settings → Environments → `nsx-<site>-<stack>` → Required reviewers**, and
`VAULT_APPLY_TOKEN` should be scoped to those environments so a plan job can
never reach it.

## How the per-manager jobs appear

GitLab cannot build a job matrix from a file at parse time, so
`scripts/gitlab-child-pipeline.py` reads `inventory/managers.yaml` and emits the
jobs as a child pipeline. Adding an eleventh Local Manager stays a data change:
add it to the inventory, and its plan job appears on the next merge request.

GitHub Actions does the same thing with `scripts/ci-matrix.py --format github`.
Both read the same `scripts/ci_matrix_lib.py`, so the two platforms cannot drift
apart.

## The approver's job

Read the **plan**, not the diff. The YAML says what somebody intended; the plan
says what Terraform will do.

- **Resource count delta matches the intent.** One rule added should not be
  fourteen resources changed.
- **No unexpected destroys.** A destroy on a rule nobody touched means map keys
  shifted — stop and find out why before approving.
- **`scope` is set on everything new or changed.** An unscoped rule goes to every
  hypervisor in the span.
- **The default rule and the Emergency category are untouched**, unless that is
  explicitly what the change is for, in which case it is a restricted change and
  needs the change advisory (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §11).

## Where this matches the standard flow, and where it does not

The shape is the usual one: feature branch, pull/merge request, CI runs fmt,
validate, data checks and plan, the plan is commented on the request, a reviewer
approves, it merges, and a CD pipeline applies on the default branch. Both
`.gitlab-ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/` implement all of that.

Two deliberate differences, both because this applies firewall rules across a
federated estate rather than creating a bucket:

**1. The apply is gated a second time, and defaults to waiting for a human.**

An approved merge request says *the change is wanted*. It does not say *this
plan, computed against the estate as it is right now, is what should be applied*.
Between approval and merge the estate can move. So merging queues the apply and
a person starts it, with the plan in front of them.

| | GitLab | GitHub |
|---|---|---|
| Gate | `when: manual` job | Environment required reviewers |
| Turn it off | `NSX_APPLY_MODE=auto` in CI/CD variables | leave the environment unprotected |

Setting it to apply on merge makes this exactly the standard diagram. That is
reasonable for a lab. On a production firewall it means a merge is the last
moment anybody sees what is about to happen.

**2. The apply does not re-plan.**

The common pattern re-runs `terraform plan` in the CD job and applies the result.
This applies the **saved plan artifact** the approver looked at. If the estate
drifted in between, the apply fails on a stale plan instead of quietly applying
something nobody reviewed. `scripts/tf.sh apply` enforces it: no saved plan, no
apply.

Everything else — fmt, validate, data schema checks, plan on every request, the
comment, the merge — is the diagram.

## Local only — the manual path

If you chose local files, there is no pipeline and no merge request. The
workflow is:

```bash
make validate                                    # schemas and conventions
make plan  STACK=local-security SITE=lon1        # writes a saved plan
make show  STACK=local-security SITE=lon1        # read it — this is the review
APPROVE=yes make apply STACK=local-security SITE=lon1
```

`scripts/tf.sh` still enforces what the pipeline relies on: no apply without a
saved plan, no apply without an explicit `APPROVE=yes`, and no apply through the
placeholder local backend. So the *shape* of the review survives even with
nobody to review it.

What is missing is the record. Nothing says who changed a rule, when, or why,
and the plan is read by the same person who wrote the change. For a lab that is
fine. For a production firewall it is the thing an audit will ask about first.

`scripts/enable-gitops.sh` adds all of it later, including writing the pipeline
files that were skipped. Nothing about the Terraform changes.

Even with a pipeline, this remains the incident path — a workstation apply when
CI is down. It leaves no record of who approved what, so it is the exception.
SCAFFOLD_EOF

write_file docs/TAGGING.md <<'SCAFFOLD_EOF'
# Tagging workloads without touching the NSX UI

Groups select workloads by tag. So the question "who applies the tag" decides
whether a firewall change is a reviewed data edit or a click nobody can audit.

This repository supports both answers. Picking the wrong one is expensive, so
read the constraint first.

## The constraint

`nsxt_policy_vm_tags` **has no per-tag ownership.** It replaces a VM's entire
tag set on every change, and removes every tag on the VM when the resource is
destroyed. There is no "manage only the tags I listed" mode, and none can be
built: the API call underneath sets the whole collection.

Two consequences follow, and everything else in this document is downstream of
them:

1. If any other system writes NSX tags on a VM that Terraform also manages, the
   two overwrite each other on every run. Terraform reports drift forever, and
   whichever ran last wins.
2. The data file must therefore always carry the **complete** tag set for a VM.
   A tag you delete from the file is a tag deleted from the VM.

## The two variants

### Variant A — another system tags, this repository consumes

The default, and the right answer for most VCF estates.

VM provisioning, vRA/VCF automation, or a CMDB sync writes the tags. This
repository never calls `nsxt_policy_vm_tags`; groups match on the tags with
dynamic criteria, and `data/vm-tags/` stays empty.

Choose this when any of the following is true — any one is decisive:

- VCF automation or vRA applies NSX tags as part of provisioning.
- A CMDB, ServiceNow sync, or vSphere tag sync writes them.
- The estate has more than a few hundred workloads to tag.

Scale is the second reason, independent of correctness: one resource per VM
across 10+ managers is tens of thousands of state entries and a refresh time
that makes daily changes impossible.

**Engineers still never open the NSX UI.** They tag in the provisioning system,
which is where a workload's identity is decided anyway. What this repository
owns is the vocabulary those tags must use — `data/schema/tag-scopes.yaml` — and
the group criteria that consume them.

### Variant B — this repository tags

For the estate where **nothing else writes NSX tags** and engineers have been
applying them by hand in the UI. That is the case this variant replaces.

```bash
make tag-vm SITE=lon1 VM=payments-web-01 ARGS='--set workload=payments-web'
make validate
make plan STACK=local-tags SITE=lon1
```

The edit lands in `data/vm-tags/lon1.yaml`, goes through pull request review like
any other change, and applies through the pipeline. No UI, and a git history of
who tagged what and why.

Choose this when all of the following hold:

- No other system writes NSX tags on these VMs.
- The set is bounded — exception workloads, hand-built servers, appliances.
- You want the tag under change control.

### Mixing them

Per **VM**, not per tag. A VM is either Terraform-tagged or it is not; there is
no half. Splitting an estate so that some VMs are in `data/vm-tags/` and the rest
come from automation is fine and common. Splitting a single VM's tags between the
two is not possible.

## How the boundary is enforced

`data/schema/tag-scopes.yaml` records an `owner` for every scope: the system that
authoritatively writes it. `make validate` **errors** if `data/vm-tags/` writes a
scope owned by anything other than `terraform`:

```
ERROR data/vm-tags/lon1.yaml: vms.web-01.tags[0]: scope 'app' is owned by
      'cmdb-sync' in data/schema/tag-scopes.yaml, so Terraform must not write it.
```

To move a scope into variant B, change its `owner` to `terraform`. That is a
reviewed change, and the review question is exactly the right one: *are we sure
nothing else tags these VMs?*

`scripts/tag-vm.py` refuses the same thing up front, so you find out before
opening a pull request rather than in CI.

## Creating a tag

NSX has no standalone tag object. A tag exists because something is tagged with
it; there is nothing to create first and nothing left behind when the last
assignment goes away. So "create a tag" means two things here:

1. **Declare it** in `data/schema/tag-scopes.yaml` — the scope, what it means,
   who owns it, and optionally a closed list of values. This is the reviewed
   step, because a scope is an API contract: renaming one silently empties every
   group that matches it.
2. **Assign it** — from the provisioning system (variant A), or from
   `data/vm-tags/` (variant B). Segments are tagged inline in
   `data/network/<site>.yaml` and groups in `data/groups/`, both of which are
   Terraform-owned already and need no decision.

The vocabulary is checked on every assignment: an unknown scope is an error, and
a value outside a declared `values` list is an error. A typo cannot reach NSX
and silently empty a group.

## Identifying a VM

`external_id` is preferred over `display_name`:

| | `display_name` | `external_id` |
|---|---|---|
| Survives a vCenter rename | no | yes |
| Unique across vCenters | no | yes |
| Readable in review | yes | no |

A `display_name` that matches nothing fails at **plan** time — the module has a
precondition, so an unresolvable name never applies as an empty id. Names are
resolved through a single `nsxt_policy_vms` inventory read per plan, not one API
call per VM.

Keep the logical key readable and put the id underneath:

```yaml
vms:
  payments-web-01:
    external_id: 502f1a2b-...
    description: Hand-built, not in the CMDB.
    tags:
      - { scope: workload, tag: payments-web }
```

## Quarantine

`quarantine` is `owner: terraform` so that isolating a workload is a reviewed
data edit rather than a click. But incident response must not depend on a
healthy pipeline: apply the tag by hand in an emergency, then reconcile the data
file afterwards. The Emergency-category policy that acts on the tag is standing
configuration and does not change during an incident — see
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 11.

## What this repository will not do

**Merge with the tags already on the VM.** Reading current tags and unioning them
into the desired set would make removal impossible and produce a permanent diff.
A tag that cannot be removed is worse than one that was never managed. If that
sounds like what you need, you want variant A.

## Why the split

State boundaries follow change cadence and blast radius, not topology. A daily
DFW rule edit must never force Terraform to refresh transport zones.

| Stack | Cadence | Blast radius | Approver |
|---|---|---|---|
| `global-security` | daily | all sites | security review |
| `local-security` | weekly | one site | site owner |
| `local-tags` | daily | the VMs listed | site owner |
| `local-network` | weekly | one site | network owner |
| `platform` | rarely | one site, total | change advisory |

`local-tags` is separate from `local-security` for the same reason: tagging
churns daily, and sharing a state would mean every tag edit refreshes every
policy. Nothing depends on it in Terraform — NSX evaluates dynamic group
membership server-side, so a tag lands and membership follows.

## Adding a manager

1. Add an entry to `inventory/managers.yaml`.
2. Add `envs/<id>.backend.hcl` (copy `envs/example.backend.hcl.example`).
3. Nothing else. CI derives its matrix from the inventory.

## Adding a rule

Edit one file under `data/policies/`. No HCL changes. `make validate` then a PR.

# that no group criteria reference it:
#   grep -R "<scope>|" data/groups/
#
# scopes:
#   <scope>:
#     description: what the scope means
#     owner:       the system that authoritatively writes this tag
#     values:      optional closed list; omit for free-form values
#     applies_to:  VirtualMachine | Segment | ... (member types that carry it)
#
# owner is load-bearing, not a comment. 'owner: terraform' is the one value that
# lets data/vm-tags/ write the scope, because nsxt_policy_vm_tags replaces a
# VM's ENTIRE tag set — writing a scope another system owns means the two
# overwrite each other forever (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md section 7). Moving a scope
# to terraform is a reviewed change: you are declaring that nothing else tags
# those VMs.

# module: group

Creates NSX policy groups from data. Keyed by `for_each` over a map with stable
string keys — never `count`.

## Input shape

```yaml
prod-payments-web:
  display_name: prod-payments-web
  owner: gm
  conjunction: AND          # joins adjacent criteria blocks; default OR
  criteria:
    - conditions:
        - key: Tag
          member_type: VirtualMachine
          operator: EQUALS
          value: "app|payments"   # scope|value
        - key: Tag
          member_type: VirtualMachine
          operator: EQUALS
          value: "tier|web"
```

Conditions inside one `criteria` block are ANDed by NSX. Separate `criteria`
blocks are joined by `conjunction`.

## Notes

- `nsx_id` is the map key, so a `display_name` change is metadata-only rather
  than a destroy-and-recreate.
- Prefer `EQUALS` over `CONTAINS`/`STARTSWITH`: `app|payments` must not also
  match `app|payments-test`.
- For subnet-based membership match `member_type: Segment` against a segment
  tag instead of hardcoding a CIDR. Segments are Terraform-owned, so their tags
  are reliable and a CIDR here would be a duplicated fact.
- Static membership (`ip_addresses`, `member_groups`) requires `why_static` in
  the data file; CI enforces it.

# module: dfw-policy

One `nsxt_policy_parent_security_policy` plus one
`nsxt_policy_security_policy_rule` per rule, built from a data file.

## Why standalone rules

Inline `rule` blocks on `nsxt_policy_security_policy` rewrite the entire policy
on every change. With one resource per rule, adding or removing a rule touches
exactly that rule. The provider forbids managing the same policy both ways —
choose per policy and record it as `rule_management` in the data file.

## Contract

- Rules arrive as a **map** keyed by stable rule id. Never a list, never
  `count`. Rename a key only if you intend a destroy-and-recreate.
- `scope` is mandatory at policy and rule level, enforced by a variable
  validation and a per-rule precondition.
- Groups and services are referenced by **logical name**; this module resolves
  them to policy paths from `group_paths` / `service_paths`. A name nothing
  defines fails at plan time with the offending rule named — in particular this
  is what catches a Global Manager policy referencing a site-local group, which
  Federation cannot span.
- `nsx_id` is set from the data key, so renaming `display_name` is
  metadata-only rather than a destroy-and-recreate.
- Sequence numbers are checked for duplicates within the policy at plan time.

## Not handled here

The **default rule** is deliberately not managed by this module. Flipping it
from ALLOW to DROP, or deleting it, black-holes a datacenter; it is a
restricted change with its own review path.

# module: segment

Creates NSX segments from `data/network/<site>.yaml`.

Transport zones are resolved by display name through a data source, so no raw
policy path appears in a data file and the same data works against any manager.

Tags are mandatory: a group that selects workloads by subnet does it by matching
`member_type: Segment` against a segment tag, never by embedding a CIDR. A CIDR
in a group is a duplicated fact that drifts from the segment's real definition.

# module: vm-tags

Writes NSX tags onto virtual machines, so that tagging a workload is a reviewed
data edit rather than a click in the NSX UI.

**This module owns the whole tag set of every VM it touches.** `nsxt_policy_vm_tags`
has no per-tag ownership: it replaces every tag on the VM on each change and
removes every tag when destroyed. Use it only where nothing else tags the VM.

## Input shape

```yaml
site: lon1
sole_tagger: >
  These VMs are hand-built and are not in the CMDB; nothing else writes their
  NSX tags.
vms:
  payments-web-01:
    display_name: payments-web-01     # or external_id, which is preferred
    tags:
      - { scope: workload, tag: payments-web }
      - { scope: quarantine, tag: active }   # complete set — omissions are removals
```

## Notes

- `external_id` beats `display_name`: it survives a rename and is unambiguous
  when two vCenters hold VMs of the same name. `display_name` is resolved
  through one `nsxt_policy_vms` call in the stack, not one call per VM.
- An unresolvable name is a **plan-time** failure, not a silent no-op.
- A scope may only be used here if `data/schema/tag-scopes.yaml` records its
  `owner` as `terraform`. That is the mechanism that keeps this module from
  fighting VCF automation or a CMDB.
- Groups consume these tags through dynamic criteria exactly as they consume
  tags from any other source — nothing in `modules/group` changes.
- This runs on a Local Manager. A Global Manager has no VM inventory.

## Scale

One resource per VM. That is fine for hundreds of exception workloads and wrong
for tens of thousands: at estate scale the tags belong in the provisioning
system, and this repository consumes them. See `docs/TAGGING.md`.

# stack: global-security

The federated DFW. One state for the federation.

- Cadence: **daily**. Blast radius: **all sites**. Approver: **security review**.
- Provider runs with `global_manager = true` and raised retries.
- Consumes every `data/policies/*.yaml` and `data/groups/*.yaml` entry marked
  `owner: gm`.

## Boundary

Objects created here are read-only on the Local Managers. A group referenced by
a policy in this stack must also be `owner: gm` — a site-local group cannot be
referenced across the span, and the dfw-policy module fails the plan if you try.

## Run

```bash
export TF_VAR_domain=global          # never leave this to default
terraform init -backend-config=../../envs/gm1.backend.hcl
terraform plan -out=tfplan -parallelism=5
```

Or from the repository root: `make plan STACK=global-security SITE=gm1`.

VM tags for one site. **One state per Local Manager.**

- Cadence: daily. Blast radius: the VMs listed. Approver: site owner.
- Reads `data/vm-tags/<site>.yaml`. A site with no such file plans clean and
  manages nothing — which is the correct posture for most estates.

```bash
make plan STACK=local-tags SITE=lon1
make tag-vm SITE=lon1 VM=payments-web-01 ARGS='--set workload=payments-web'
```

**Before you put a VM in here, read `docs/TAGGING.md`.** This stack takes
ownership of the entire tag set of every VM it lists, because the underlying
resource has no per-tag ownership. In an estate where VCF automation or a CMDB
also writes NSX tags, that is a fight Terraform loses slowly and silently.

A Global Manager cannot run this stack: VM inventory is local to each Local
Manager.

"""Add a rule to an EXISTING policy. Never create a second one beside it.

A policy is reused, not recreated. If policy X exists, a new rule for X belongs
inside X — a second policy with the same name means two nsx_ids, two orderings,
and rules that silently never match because the wrong policy won the sequence.

So this tool looks the policy up first, and only creates one when told to:

  # add a rule to whatever file already holds prod-payments
  scripts/add-rule.py --policy prod-payments \
      --rule web-from-monitoring \
      --action ALLOW --direction IN \
      --source prod-monitoring --destination prod-payments-web \
      --service https --scope prod-payments-web

  # policy does not exist yet — refuses unless you say so explicitly
  scripts/add-rule.py --policy brand-new ... --create-policy \
      --category Application --owner gm

The policy is found by id, then by display name, across every file in
data/policies/. The rule is appended to that file, in place, preserving the
comments around it. Sequence numbers are allocated, not guessed: the next free
multiple of 100 after the highest existing rule, so there is room to insert.

Nothing here talks to NSX. Run 'make validate' and open a PR as usual.

"""Set or clear NSX tags on a VM, as a data edit.

The point of this script is that tagging a workload never requires the NSX UI
and never requires hand-editing YAML: it edits data/vm-tags/<site>.yaml, and the
local-tags stack applies it.

  scripts/tag-vm.py --site lon1 --vm payments-web-01 --set workload=payments-web
  scripts/tag-vm.py --site lon1 --vm payments-web-01 --set quarantine=active
  scripts/tag-vm.py --site lon1 --vm payments-web-01 --unset quarantine
  scripts/tag-vm.py --site lon1 --vm payments-web-01 --remove
  scripts/tag-vm.py --site lon1 --list

--set replaces the value for that scope and leaves the rest of the VM's tags
alone. That is a convenience of this script, not of the underlying resource:
nsxt_policy_vm_tags still replaces the whole tag set on apply, which is why the
data file must always hold the complete set. Removing the last tag would strip
the VM, so --unset refuses it and tells you to use --remove.

Run make validate afterwards; it enforces the scope ownership rule.

"""Adopt an existing NSX estate into this repository.

The estate exists already. Nothing here creates NSX objects — it reads what is
there and writes it out as data files plus Terraform import blocks, so that
Terraform takes ownership of the objects you already run instead of building a
parallel set beside them.

Two sources:

  # live manager — credentials from the environment, as everywhere else
  scripts/with-credentials.sh lon1 -- scripts/import-estate.py --site lon1

  # offline: capture once, convert as often as you like
  scripts/with-credentials.sh lon1 -- scripts/import-estate.py --site lon1 \
      --dump-only reports/lon1-raw.json
  scripts/import-estate.py --site lon1 --from-dump reports/lon1-raw.json

What it writes (never over the top of anything):

  data/groups/imported-<site>.yaml     groups, criteria converted from expressions
  data/policies/<policy-id>.yaml       one file per policy, so add-rule.py finds it
  data/services/imported-<site>.yaml   custom services; predefined ones referenced
  stacks/<stack>/import.tf             import blocks for terraform
  data/.import-manifest.json           what was imported, and from where

If a target file already exists it is written as <name>.new and reported. Your
data is never overwritten by this tool, and bootstrap.sh refuses to overwrite
anything listed in the manifest even with --force-data.

IMPORT ID FORMAT: policy resources in the nsxt provider have taken more than
one import id format across versions — the policy path, or "domain/id". This
script defaults to the path and can emit either (--id-format). Confirm on your
first tranche: a wrong format fails immediately and harmlessly at plan time
with a "not found" style error, before anything is written to state.

# inventory/managers.yaml — scripts/tf.sh finds it that way.
#
#   terraform init -backend-config=envs/<site>.backend.hcl
#
# Whatever backend is chosen must give three things: encryption at rest, state
# LOCKING, and access restricted to the pipeline identity. State carries the

#
# NEVER PUT A SECRET IN THIS FILE. It is committed. Backend credentials come
# from the environment — see each example below.
#
# NEVER COMMIT THE STATE ITSELF. Not to this repository, not to another one.
# State holds every rule, group and credential-shaped value in plaintext; git
# history is permanent and cannot be pruned once pushed, and git gives you no
# locking, so two concurrent runs silently diverge. .gitignore blocks *.tfstate
# for this reason.
#
# Pick the backend with: scripts/bootstrap.sh --force --backend TYPE

# --- example: http — GitLab-managed Terraform state ------------------------
# Locking, encryption at rest and version history come from GitLab, with no
# object store to run. One state per stack per manager, so the state NAME at the
# end of the address must be unique per pair.

# A local GitLab, for teams that do not have one

`scripts/gitlab-up.sh` brings up GitLab CE and a runner in Docker, waits for it,
prints the initial root password, creates a project for this repository, pushes
to it, and registers the runner so the review pipeline works end to end.

```bash
scripts/gitlab-up.sh              # start, create the project, push
scripts/gitlab-up.sh --status     # where it is and whether it is healthy
scripts/gitlab-up.sh --password   # print the initial root password again
scripts/gitlab-up.sh --down       # stop, keep all data
scripts/gitlab-up.sh --destroy    # stop and delete the volumes
```

First boot takes several minutes — GitLab migrates its database before it
answers. The script waits and tells you what it is waiting for.

## What you get

- GitLab at `http://localhost:8929`, user `root`, password printed by the script
  and readable again with `--password`.
- A project containing this repository, with `.gitlab-ci.yml` already in it.
- A registered runner using the Docker executor.

## What it is not

Not a production GitLab. No TLS, no backups, no HA, and the initial root
password lives in a file inside the container for 24 hours. Change it at first
login. For a production estate use a real GitLab and point
`scripts/enable-gitops.sh` at it instead.

## Before the pipeline can plan against a manager

Set these in the project, under Settings → CI/CD → Variables:

| Variable | Value | Flags |
|---|---|---|
| `VAULT_ADDR` | your Vault endpoint | masked |
| `VAULT_PLAN_TOKEN` | a **read-only** token | masked |
| `VAULT_APPLY_TOKEN` | a write token | masked, **protected** |
| `CI_API_TOKEN` | project token, `api` scope — lets the pipeline post plans to the MR | masked |

`VAULT_APPLY_TOKEN` must be protected, so it is only available on protected
branches. That is what stops a feature branch from applying anything.

 GitLab is ready
===================================================================

  URL       $GITLAB_URL
  Project   $GITLAB_URL/root/$PROJECT_NAME
  Username  root
  Password  ${pw:-(expired — Omnibus deletes it 24h after first boot;
            reset with: docker exec -it nsx-gitlab gitlab-rake "gitlab:password:reset[root]")}

Change that password at first login.

Next, so the pipeline can reach your NSX managers — Settings -> CI/CD ->
Variables in the project:

  VAULT_ADDR          your Vault endpoint            masked
  VAULT_PLAN_TOKEN    a READ-ONLY token              masked
  VAULT_APPLY_TOKEN   a write token                  masked, PROTECTED
  CI_API_TOKEN        project token, 'api' scope     masked

Then protect the default branch (Settings -> Repository -> Protected branches)
so only the pipeline can apply. docs/GITOPS.md explains the whole flow.

Version control is on. What is left is on the git host, not here:

  1. Push:            git push -u origin $BRANCH
  2. Protect '$BRANCH' so nobody can push to it directly.
  3. Require an approval on merge requests / pull requests.
  4. Set the CI variables so the pipeline can plan:
       VAULT_ADDR, VAULT_PLAN_TOKEN (read-only),
       VAULT_APPLY_TOKEN (write, PROTECTED), CI_API_TOKEN
  5. Open a merge request with a small rule change and confirm the plan
     appears on it before trusting the pipeline with anything real.

docs/GITOPS.md is the whole flow, including who approves what.

## What changed

<!-- One site or one application per merge request. One spanning several sites
     cannot be rolled back cleanly. -->

## Change class

- [ ] **Routine** — rule added/removed in an existing policy, or a member added
      to a static group
- [ ] **Elevated** — new policy or category, new or changed group criteria, new
      segment, new tag scope
- [ ] **Restricted** — default rule, Emergency category, tag scope rename or
      removal, GM/LM ownership move, anything in `platform`

Ticket:

## Plan review — read the PLAN, not the YAML

The pipeline posts a plan per manager onto this merge request.

- [ ] The resource **count delta** matches the intent
- [ ] **No unexpected destroys** — a destroy on an untouched rule means keys shifted
- [ ] No change to the **default rule** and none to the Emergency category
- [ ] Every new or changed rule has a **non-empty `scope`**
- [ ] Group criteria changes: **membership blast radius** checked in NSX *before* approval
- [ ] Sequence numbers do not collide and preserve intended ordering
- [ ] The change touches **one site's state**, unless deliberately global

## What changed

<!-- One site or one application per PR. A PR spanning multiple sites cannot be
     rolled back cleanly. -->

## Change class

- [ ] **Routine** — rule added/removed in an existing policy, or a member added
      to a static group
- [ ] **Elevated** — new policy or category, new or changed group criteria, new
      segment, new tag scope
- [ ] **Restricted** — default rule, Emergency category, tag scope rename or
      removal, GM↔LM ownership move, anything in `platform`

Ticket:

## Plan review

- [ ] The resource **count delta** matches the intent
- [ ] **No unexpected destroys** — a destroy on an untouched rule means keys shifted
- [ ] No change to the **default rule** and none to the Emergency category
- [ ] Every new or changed rule has a **non-empty `scope`**
- [ ] Group criteria changes: **membership blast radius** checked in NSX *before* approval
- [ ] Sequence numbers do not collide and preserve intended ordering
- [ ] The change touches **one site's state**, unless deliberately global

write_file inventory/README.md <<'SCAFFOLD_EOF'
# inventory

`managers.yaml` is the single registry of every NSX manager in the estate. It is
the only place a manager is declared: CI derives its run matrix from it,
`scripts/tf.sh` resolves host and domain from it, and
`scripts/with-credentials.sh` reads the Vault **path** from it.

It never contains a secret. `vault_path` records where the credential lives, not
what it is; `scripts/validate-data.py` fails the build if a key that looks like a
credential appears here.

## Adding a manager

1. Add the entry below the others, keyed by a short stable id (`lon1`, `nyc1`).
   That id is the site name used everywhere else — data files, backend config,
   CI job names.
2. Create `envs/<id>.backend.hcl`.
3. Store the credential in Vault at the recorded path.

Nothing else. If adding a manager requires editing Terraform code, the
abstraction is wrong.

## Fields

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `role` | `gm` (Global Manager) or `lm` (Local Manager) |
| `host` | Manager FQDN, exported as `NSXT_MANAGER_HOST` |
| `site` | Physical site this manager serves |
| `region` | Grouping for reporting |
| `vcf_instance` | Which VCF instance / SDDC Manager owns it |
| `sddc_manager` | SDDC Manager FQDN, for the VCF credential lookup |
| `vault_path` | Vault path holding the credential. Path only. |
| `tier` | `prod`, `preprod`, `nonprod`, `lab` |
| `domain` | NSX domain. On a GM, a domain id or site id — set it explicitly. |
| `stacks` | Which stacks run against this manager. Defaults by role. |
| `enabled` | Set `false` to drop a manager out of the CI matrix without deleting it |

managers and one site that exist nowhere, written so the validators and
terraform have something to chew on.

scripts/readiness.sh treats its presence as "this estate is not real yet".
DELETE IT once you have replaced the example data with your own; re-running the
generator will not bring it back.

next steps
  1. make preflight              check the tools this repository needs
  2. make validate               schema + convention checks, offline
  3. Edit inventory/managers.yaml so it describes the real estate, and add one
     envs/<site>.backend.hcl per manager.
  4. Decide the state backend and replace the placeholder in stacks/*/backend.tf.
     The local backend is not acceptable for a real manager.
  5. terraform init in one stack, then commit the generated .terraform.lock.hcl.

what still needs a human decision (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md section 14)
  * state backend, encryption and locking
  * Vault mount, path convention, and auth method for the pipeline
  * whether Application category is GM-owned or delegated per site
  * which site is the brownfield import pilot
