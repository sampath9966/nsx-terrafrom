# nsx-terraform

Terraform for **NSX across a multi-VCF estate** — one Global Manager owning the
federated distributed firewall, 10+ Local Managers owning their own networking,
and every day-to-day change made as reviewed data rather than as an HCL edit or
a click in the NSX UI.

This repository is the **generator and the design**. `scripts/bootstrap.sh`
writes the working tree — modules, stacks, schemas, tooling, CI and worked
example data — into whatever directory you point it at.

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh          # interactive: pick basic or advanced, answer, done
```

```
 1) Basic deployment      — best practices assumed, four questions
 2) Advanced deployment   — every option asked
 3) Update an existing tree
 4) Add version control and the review pipeline to an existing tree
 5) Dry run               — show what a basic run would write
```

**Basic** asks where to put it, **where the files live and how changes get
reviewed**, which state backend, and whether to include the worked example —
everything else takes the recommended answer. **Advanced** asks about every
flag. Either way it prints the equivalent command line before it
writes anything, so one pass teaches you the scripted form:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh --dir ~/work/nsx --backend gitlab --git-init
cd ~/work/nsx && make validate              # offline checks, no credentials
```

Any flag on the command line suppresses the menu, so CI is unaffected.

`docs/SETUP.md` walks the whole thing, including the choices you have to make.

> clones keep working. `git remote set-url origin` when convenient.

## What problem it solves

In an estate of this size the firewall is edited daily, by several people,
across more than ten managers. Doing that through the NSX UI gives you no
review, no history, and no way to answer *why does this rule exist*. Doing it as
hand-written HCL gives you review, but a rule change becomes a code change and
the blast radius of a mistake is a live datacenter.

So rules are **data**:

```yaml
# data/policies/payments.yaml
rules:
  allow-web-to-app:
    sequence_number: 300
    source_groups: [prod-payments-web]
    destination_groups: [prod-payments-app]
    services: [https]
    scope: [prod-payments-app]     # mandatory: bounds where the rule is pushed
    action: ALLOW
```

and nobody writes even that by hand:

```bash
make add-rule POLICY=prod-payments RULE=allow-web-to-app \
  ARGS='--source prod-payments-web --destination prod-payments-app --service https --scope prod-payments-app'
make validate
make plan STACK=global-security SITE=gm1
```

Group membership comes from tags, so it follows the workload instead of being
maintained by hand. Tagging is automated too — either from your provisioning
system or from this repository — so **no part of the daily loop needs the NSX
UI**. That choice is `docs/TAGGING.md`.

## What the generator produces

| | |
|---|---|
| **7 modules** | `dfw-policy`, `group`, `service`, `segment`, `vm-tags`, `tier1`, `tier0`. `for_each` over stable keys, never `count`. |
| **5 stacks** | `global-security`, `local-security`, `local-tags`, `local-network`, `platform`. One state boundary each, instantiated once per manager. |
| **Schemas** | JSON Schema for every data file, plus the tag scope vocabulary. Enforced in CI. |
| **Tooling** | Validation, CI matrix, credential handling, estate import, rule and tag editing, drift reporting. |
| **CI** | Validate on every PR; plan per site from a matrix derived from the inventory. |

It is self-contained: no network, no package install, and no dependency on this
repository once generated. It copies itself and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` into the
tree it creates, so that tree can regenerate and update itself.

It is also idempotent and non-destructive — see below.

## A rule change is a merge request

Nobody edits the firewall. They edit a file, and a pipeline turns that into a
plan somebody approves:

```
edit data/policies/payments.yaml
  -> push, open a merge request
  -> VALIDATE  schemas and conventions, offline, no credentials
  -> PLAN      one job per manager, READ-ONLY credentials,
               rendered plan posted onto the merge request
  -> APPROVER  reads the plan, approves
  -> MERGE     to the default branch
  -> APPLY     MANUAL job, protected environment, applies the SAVED plan
```

**The apply never re-plans.** It applies the artifact the approver looked at, so
what was reviewed is what reaches the firewall.

**GitLab is the default**, because it is the only host this script can take all
the way — server, project, runner, CI variables and the approval gate. GitHub
gets complete workflows, but its secrets and environment protection are yours to
set. Local-only writes no pipeline at all and leaves the manual path.

| Choice | Written | Done for you |
|---|---|---|
| **GitLab** *(default)* | `.gitlab-ci.yml` + child pipeline + MR template | remote, and optionally the whole server |
| GitHub | `.github/workflows/{validate,plan,apply}.yml` + PR template | remote only |
| Another git host | both | remote only; location printed |
| Local only | nothing | nothing — `make plan` / `make apply` |

Three ways to turn it on:

```bash
scripts/enable-gitops.sh --remote git@gitlab.example.com:net/nsx.git
scripts/enable-gitops.sh --local-gitlab   # no GitLab? stand one up in Docker
scripts/bootstrap.sh                      # or answer the question at first run
```

`--local-gitlab` runs GitLab CE and a runner in Docker, creates the project,
pushes, registers the runner, and prints the initial root password. A lab
instance, not a production one.

The per-manager jobs come from `inventory/managers.yaml`, so adding an eleventh
Local Manager stays a data change. GitLab and GitHub read the same
`scripts/ci_matrix_lib.py` and cannot drift apart.

## Why the state is split five ways

By **change cadence and blast radius**, not topology — a daily rule edit must
never force Terraform to refresh transport zones.

| Stack | Runs on | Cadence | Blast radius | Approver |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `global-security` | GM | daily | all sites | security review |
| `local-security` | each LM | weekly | one site | site owner |
| `local-tags` | each LM | daily | the VMs listed | site owner |
| `local-network` | each LM | weekly | one site | network owner |
| `platform` | each LM | rarely | one site, total | change advisory |

Adding an eleventh Local Manager is a data change in `inventory/managers.yaml`,
not a code change: CI derives its run matrix from there.

## Re-running the generator is safe

The case that matters is day two: months in, the tree is full of your work, and
somebody re-runs the generator to pick up an update.

**With no flag, nothing that already exists is ever overwritten.** Differing
files are kept and reported, and the run exits `2`. Missing files are still
added, so this is the safe way to take additions.

**Overwriting takes a flag *and* a typed phrase.** `--force` alone does not do
it — the first file that would be overwritten stops the run and asks you to type
`wipe everything & start fresh` in full. Anything else aborts with nothing
changed. The prompt states whether estate data is in scope.

Three things hold in every mode: it **never deletes**; imported estate recorded
in `data/.import-manifest.json` is **never** overwritten, flag and phrase or not;
and without a terminal an overwrite **aborts** instead of proceeding (pipelines
pass `--confirm 'wipe everything & start fresh'` deliberately).

| Command | Overwrites |
|---|---|
| *(no flag)* | nothing — differing files kept, exit 2 |
| `--force` | generator output only: modules, stacks, scripts, schemas, CI, docs |
| `--force-data` | the above **and** `data/`, `inventory/`, `envs/` |

## Documentation

Two documents live here. The rest are written into the tree the generator
creates, because they describe that tree.

## Status — read before acting

**The scaffold exists and has never touched a live manager.** What has been
verified, offline:

- `terraform fmt -check` clean; all five stacks pass `terraform validate`
  against the real `vmware/nsxt` provider (3.12.0, resolved from `~> 3.9`).
- Data wiring evaluated with `terraform console`; group and policy filtering by
  owner and site confirmed.
- `scripts/validate-data.py` passes on the example data and was tested against
  deliberately planted defects.
- The generator reproduces itself byte-for-byte.

What that does **not** cover:

- **No `terraform plan` has run against an NSX manager.** Provider schema
  validity is not API validity.
- **The state backend is a placeholder** `backend "local"`. It is not acceptable
  for a real manager, and `scripts/tf.sh` refuses to apply through it.
- **All example data describes no real site.** Replace it, or generate with
  `--no-examples`.

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 14 lists every decision deliberately left to the
owner. Section 2 — ten things that will break this repository — is worth reading
before the first change.
